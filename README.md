This edition uses vanilla SCS map as a base and it aims to keep original SCS map experience.

This edition features the following map mods: Major Urban Overhaul, Coast to Coast, Montana Expansion, Island Map, and more.

Notice - This edition is discontinued due to several reasons. Reasons includes:
* Lack of contents and improvement mods present in ATS
* This was designed as alternative to Reforma Map due to rumors about rescaling, which would cause incompatibility in the near future. However that information is from TerraMaps discord and cannot confirm about it since there is no proofs about it so we decided to consider it as false rumor

## Special Thanks to
* GMC Logistics, Vinnie Terranova for map combo examples and references
* All map creators from ETS2/ATS for your awesome works
